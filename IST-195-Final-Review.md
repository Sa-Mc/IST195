### The World Wide Web
 - The Internet: worldwide collection of computer networks that connects millions of businesses, governments, institutions, and individuals
	 - Began as a networking project started by the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense in order to build a communication network that could still function even if part of it were disabled or destroyed
	 - Now consists of many local, regional, national, and international networks, both public and private
 - The Web: A worldwide collection of electronic documents (webpages) which are collected into websites
 
### Internet browsers

### Internet protocols
- SMTP:
- VoIP (Voice over IP): Enables users to speak to other users via their Internet connection
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Permits file uploading and downloading to and from other devices

### Connecting to the Internet
- IP (Internet Protocol) Address: A sequence of numbers that uniquely identifies the location of each device connected to the internet
	- IPv4 address: 74.125.224.72
	- IPv6 address: 2001:4860:4860::8844
- Domain: A text-based name that corresponds to the IP address of a server that hosts a website
- Internet Service Provider (ISP): A business that provides individuals and organizations access to the Internet free or for a fee

- Different subsets (ex: desktop publishing, paint/image editing, video editing, etc)
- What are the different tools used in each of these applications and why would you use them?

### Security filters
- Focus on virus and malware
- Programs and techniques used in security

## Chapter 5: Threats, Issues, and Defenses

- Common types of malware (ex: virus, worm, trojan horse, etc)

### Cybercrime
- Types of cybercrime perpetrators (ex: cracker, hacker, script kiddie)

### Access controls
- Different strategies and methods for access control (password, usernames, pins, etc)'
- Username: Unique combination of characters that identifies a specific user
- Biometric Devices used for Access Control

### Information Privacy
- Right of individuals and companies to deny or restrict the collection
- Why is this important to users?

## Chapter 6: Processors, Memory, the Cloud

### The Internet of Things
- What is IoT?
- What kind of network technology makes the IoT work?
	- Mesh Networking

### Cloud Computing
- What are the four reasons to move to the cloud?
- What are the different cloud computing services?
	- Cloud storage: provides remote storage to users

### Data Representation
- What are the different coding schemes?

### Memory
- What are the different types of memory?
- What are the functions of each of these different types?

## Chapter 7: Extending Capabilities of Computers

### Input Devices
- Input Device: Any hardware component that allows a user to enter data and instructions into a computer or mobile device
- Examples: Keyboard, mouse, touchpad, microphone, webcam 

### Output Devices
- Output Device: Any hardware component that conveys information from a computer or mobile device to one or more people
- Examples: Printer, Display, Speakers, Earbuds, and Headphones

### What are the different guidelines for input/output devices?
- Ex: Ways to protect your credit card from scanning devices

## Chapter 8: Preserving Content Locally and the Cloud
### Storage vs. Memory
- Storage: Holds data, instructions, and information for future use
	- Items that are stored remain intact even if the computer is powered off
- Memory: Consists of electronic components that store instructions waiting to be executed and the data needed by those instructions
	- Most forms keep data and instructions temporarily, which means its contents are erased when the device is powered off

### Storage Devices
- Storage Device: Records (writes) and/or retrieves (reads) items to and from physical storage media
	- Function as a source of input and output because they transfer items from storage to memory and vice versa
- Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Storage device that contains one or more inflexible, circular platters that use magnetic particles to store items.
- Solid State Drive (SSD): Storage device that typically uses flash memory to store items. 
	- Writes/reads faster than HDD and contains no moving parts, making it more durable
- Other Examples: USB Flash Drives, Memory Cards, and Optical Discs

### Enterprise Storage
- What are the different types of enterprise storage? Ex: RAID
	- RAID: Backup technique that provides applications with reliable data access in the event that the original data is unavailable.

### Network Architectures
- What are the different network architectures and the advantages/disadvantages of each?

#### Networking Model
- Workgroup
	- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Environment: Tasks are allocated among all the members of the network, all computers considered equal
		- Each computer maintains own set of resources, accounts, and security information
		- Pros: Easy-to-share and distributed resources, simple to design, easy to implement, effective for small environments, less expensive as it does not require a central server
		- Cons: No centralized administration, account management, security administration, or control of resources 
- Domain
	- Client/Server Environment: Centralizes all shared resources
		- Pros: Centralized resource sharing/controls and centralized account/security management, efficient performance for virtually unlimited number of workstations
		- Cons: Significant administrative effort and overhead, complicated designs, requires one or more powerful servers, absolute security is hard to achieve

#### Topology
- Mesh Topology:
	- Pros: Simplest, dedicated links, robustness, privacy, most fault tolerant
	- Cons: A lot of cabling, I/O ports, difficult to move, expensive
- Star Topology:
	- Pros: Cheap, easy to install, easy to reconfigure, fault tolerant
	- Cons: Single point of failure
- Bus Topology:
	- Pros: Cheap, easy to install
	- Cons: Difficult to reconfigure, break in bus disables entire network
- Ring: 
	- Pros: Efficient, easy to install
	- Cons: Reconfiguration difficult, expensive
